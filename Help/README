			Memo
			Reminds you about things
			by Thomas Leonard

Brief
~~~~~
Memo is a small utility which you can use to store appointments and 'TODO'
items. It displays the next few entries in a small window, and can also be
instructed to bring up alert windows at set times.

It's written in Python, so you don't need to compile it before using it.
If you're NOT using Zero Install, you'll need to install ROX-Lib before
running Memo:

	http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/ROX-Lib

To run Memo, click on its icon in a filer window, or run the 'AppRun' script.

No installation is required, but you can copy it anywhere you want using
the filer.

If you have a D-BUS notification service running then it will use that to
display alarms. Otherwise, it will use a built-in dialog box. For more
information about notification services, see:

	http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/

Using D-BUS notification is the recommended, as it gives you the new features
including early notification and custom Memo sounds.

The time display was inspired by Jon Ribbens' RoughtTime clock.

Memo can also be run as a panel applet on a ROX-Filer panel. This code is
based on code from MiniClock, by Edoardo Spadolini and Dennis Tomas.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When run, a small window appears displaying the current time and a list of
the next few memos (if any) below.

Right-click for a menu.

To create a new memo:

- Click on the button displaying the time - the 'Create memo:' window
  appears.

- Type in a message to yourself in the large white square. The first line
  will be used to display a summary of the memo.

- Use the calendar display to select a date for the memo.

- You can also specify a time for the memo by clicking on the 'At...'
  check box. Use the arrows that appear to set the time.

  Memos with a time are alarms and will cause a box to appear when they go
  off. If Memo is not running when the alarm goes off, it will be shown next
  time Memo is run.
  
  You may select the "Advanced Options" area for memos with a time for extra
  customization of the alarm.

  Memos without times are just TODO items. They are displayed under the time
  until you get rid of them, but don't bring up an alert box.

- Click Set to add the memo to the list.

Changes are automatically saved.

If you set a time, then Memo will display the message in the best way it can.
See the "Dbus Notifications" and "Old Popup" sections below.

To edit (or hide or delete) a memo from the main window, double-click on it in
the list.

This brings up the editing box. When editing a memo (rather than creating a new
one) there are two extra buttons. Hide works as in the alert box (described
above), and Delete gets rid of the memo completely. There is no undelete;
use Hide if you might want it back.

Not all memos are displayed in the main window. Hidden memos aren't shown, and
neither are memos far in the future. To see all memos, open the menu and
choose 'Show All...'. This window displays a list of all memos that Memo
knows about.

You can click on the boxes in the 'Hide' column to hide or unhide memos.
Hidden memos are never displayed in the main window and do not open alert
boxes. Unhidden ones might or might not be displayed, depending on how far
in the future they are and how full the main window is.

Delete allows you to permanently remove a group of memos (select them first),
and Edit works like double clicking.

By choosing 'Options...' from the popup menu you can configure various
things about Memo. Hold the pointer over an option to find out what it does.


New Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have dbus and notification-daemon installed on your system (which is
recommended!), Memo will use this to popup the message when the time is up, but
only for Memos that have a time set.

You may configure a sound file in the Options pane, or for a specific Memo.
This is passed to the notification-daemon as the 'sound-file' hint, and not
actually played directly by the Memo program.  This means that unless your
notification-daemon has sound support (Versions 0.3.6 and lower do not), you
will not hear the sound.

If you have configured an "early" reminder in the Options pane (by default this
is disabled), the Memo will first be displayed with "normal" urgency at the
specified number of minutes before the actual Memo time.

When the Memo time arrives, the Memo will be displayed with "critical" urgency.
The notification popup has four buttons:

  Hide memo
  	Removes the message from the main window.  You can still retrieve it
	later.  If you hide an early reminder, you will NOT be notified when the
	real Memo time is reached.

  Delete
  	Removes the message from the main window and deletes it.  You will not
	be able to retrieve it.   If you hide an early reminder, you will NOT be
	notified when the real Memo time is reached.

  Edit
	Returns you to the box used to create the memo. You can use this to
	move the memo to a later date (useful for repeating memos) or delete
	it.

  Ok/Later
  	This simply closes the notification.  In the case of early notification,
	you will be notified by a critical alert when the actual Memo time is
	reached.  The button is labeled 'Later' for early notifications, or
	'Ok' otherwise.


Old Popups
~~~~~~~~~~
The 'Old Popups' method does not play sounds or support early notifications.

If dbus is not avialable, then Memo will beep twice and display the message in
a dialog box when the time is up. The alert box that appears has three buttons:

  Hide memo
	Removes the message from the main window. You can still retrieve
	it later.

  Edit
	Returns you to the box used to create the memo. You can use this to
	move the memo to a later date (useful for repeating memos) or delete
	it.

  OK
	The memo remains displayed in the main window until you get rid of it.
	No futher alarm boxes will appear for it unless you edit it again.


Timezones
~~~~~~~~~
All times are displayed and input in your local time, but stored internally
as seconds since a fixed date.

Therefore, if you set an alarm for 7pm and then change timezones, the alarm
may now appear to have changed time. It will go off when the time is 7pm IN
THE ZONE WHERE YOU SET THE MEMO.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Problem: "None of the sound files I have specified are playing!"

Reason:  Sounds are only supported with D-BUS and notification-daemon, and will
not be played with the old-style dialog popup.

Furthermore, at the time of this writing, notification-daemon does not yet play
sounds (notification-daemon-0.3.6 and earlier).

There is a trac ticket against notification-daemon at http://trac.galago-project.org/ticket/111 with a patch against the current SVN version, which will
hopefully be applied and available in a later release.  This patch uses
gstreamer to play any 'sound-file' hint specified
