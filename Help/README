			Memo
			Reminds you about things
			by Thomas Leonard

Brief
~~~~~
Memo is a small utility which you can use to store appointments and 'TODO'
items. It displays the next few entries in a small window, and can also be
instructed to beep and bring up a window with a message later.

It's written in python, so you don't need to compile it before using it, but
you will require the 'pygtk' (or 'gnome-python') package, and ROX-Lib:

	http://rox.sourceforge.net

To run, click on its icon in a filer window.

No installation is required, but you can copy it anywhere you want using
the filer.

The time display was inspired by Jon Ribbens' RoughtTime clock.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When run, a small window appears displaying the current time and a list of
the next few memos below.

Right-click for a menu.

To create a new memo:

- Click on the button displaying the time - the 'Create memo:' window
  appears.

- Type in a message to yourself in the large white square.

- Use the calendar display to select a date for the memo.

- You can also specify a time for the memo by clicking on the 'At...'
  check box. Use the arrows that appear to set the time.

  Memos with a time are alarms and will cause a box to appear when they go
  off.

- Click OK to add the memo to the list.

To edit or remove a memo, click on it in the list.


Timezones
~~~~~~~~~
All times are displayed and input in your local time, but stored internally
as seconds since a fixed date.

Therefore, if you set an alarm for 7pm and then change timezones, the alarm
may now appear to have changed time. It will go off when the time is 7pm IN
THE ZONE WHERE YOU SET THE MEMO.
