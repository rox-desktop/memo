			Memo
			Reminds you about things
			by Thomas Leonard

Brief
~~~~~
Memo is a small utility which you can use to store appointments and 'TODO'
items. It displays the next few entries in a small window, and can also be
instructed to beep and bring up alert windows at set times.

It's written in python, so you don't need to compile it before using it, but
you will require ROX-Lib2 (the Gtk+-2.0 version of ROX-Lib):

	http://rox.sourceforge.net

To run Memo, click on its icon in a filer window, or run the 'AppRun' script.

No installation is required, but you can copy it anywhere you want using
the filer.

The time display was inspired by Jon Ribbens' RoughtTime clock.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When run, a small window appears displaying the current time and a list of
the next few memos (if any) below.

Right-click for a menu.

To create a new memo:

- Click on the button displaying the time - the 'Create memo:' window
  appears.

- Type in a message to yourself in the large white square. The first line
  will be used to display a summary of the memo.

- Use the calendar display to select a date for the memo.

- You can also specify a time for the memo by clicking on the 'At...'
  check box. Use the arrows that appear to set the time.

  Memos with a time are alarms and will cause a box to appear when they go
  off. If Memo is not running when the alarm goes off, it will be shown next
  time Memo is run.

  Memos without times are just TODO items. They are displayed under the time
  until you get rid of them, but don't bring up an alert box.

- Click Set to add the memo to the list.

Changes are automatically saved.

If you set a time, then Memo will beep twice and display the message in
a box when the time is up. The alert box that appears has three buttons:

  Hide memo

	Removes the message from the main window. You can still retrieve
	it later.

  Edit

	Returns you to the box used to create the memo. You can use this to
	move the memo to a later date (useful for repeating memos) or delete
	it.

  OK

	The memo remains displayed in the main window until you get rid of it.
	No futher alarm boxes will appear for it unless you edit it again.

To edit (or hide or delete) a memo from the main window, double-click on it in
the list.

This brings up the editing box. When editing a memo (rather than creating a new
one) there are two extra buttons. Hide works as in the alert box (described
above), and Delete gets rid of the memo completely. There is no undelete;
use Hide if you might want it back.

Not all memos are display in the main window. Hidden memos aren't shown, and
neither are memos far in the future. To see all memos, open the menu and
choose 'Show All...'. This window displays a list of all memos that Memo
knows about.

You can click on the boxes in the 'Hide' column to hide or unhide memos.
Hidden memos are never displayed in the main window and do not open alert
boxes. Unhidden ones might or might not be displayed, depending on how far
in the future they are and how full the main window is.

Delete allows you to permanently remove a group of memos (select them first),
and Edit works like double clicking.

By choosing 'Options...' from the popup menu you can configure various
things about Memo. Hold the pointer over an option to find out what it does.


Timezones
~~~~~~~~~
All times are displayed and input in your local time, but stored internally
as seconds since a fixed date.

Therefore, if you set an alarm for 7pm and then change timezones, the alarm
may now appear to have changed time. It will go off when the time is 7pm IN
THE ZONE WHERE YOU SET THE MEMO.
